# Task 1
# Project 1: Contactless Sanitizer dispenser

This project is very relevant right now. This can be an alternative to the foot based mechanical ones deployed currently. The basic concept is it has a proximity sensor(could be IR or ultrasonic as well) which is the input device. Once it reads that a hand is in close proximity to the nozzle it signals the servo motors to proceed with the rotation to pump out sanitizer. This is all done with an Arduino UNO. Use two servo motors for a balance motion.

# Project 2: IoT based Thermal Alarm

This project sends a SMS to your mobile phone if the temperature of the device or room you're monitoring crosses a set threshold. As expected this has a wide ranging applications in mmany fields and industries as temperature is a key factor for anything. Here this is achieved by using the Bolt IoT Bolt WiFi module to read the data and relay it to the Twilio Messaging. The sensor used is LM35(Temperature sensor). We can add more output devices like buzzers and LEDs to show the current state apart from the SMS alerts. This can be improved using a better temperature sensor and has a lot of scope in industries as by adding in more sensors we can remotely monitor the parameters of equipment.

# Project 3: Controlling 2 motors using a JoyStick

This project uses a Joystick, few pushbuttons and 2 servo motors. The basic working is that when the joystick is moved the respective push buttons are pressed leading to them activating the servo motors. This requires minimal material to do and the motors can be connected to different things to alter their orientation in 2 dimensions

# Project 4: Biometric Student Attendance

This project is used to mark the attendance of students and teachers with their fingerprints. So for this we use a fingerprint sensor module, an Arduino UNO and create GUI apps using visual basic 2010 express edition. We use a 433 MHz wireless module for transmission Since this is outdated we can use the latest version as well to create the app. This is the basic set up of the project where it shows a tick mark for people who logged in after registering their fingerprint. We can also use the Xampp server to maintain and record all this data in a MySQL database for future reference. This has multiple applications as well as we can store other forms of biometric data as and use this same basic concept as a security device. We could also recored the temperatures of people when they check in especially in the post covid world.
